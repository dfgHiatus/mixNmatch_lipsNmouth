## Usage
0. Install [ResoniteModLoader](https://github.com/resonite-modding-group/ResoniteModLoader).
1. Build and place your DLL under "rml_mods". This folder should be at `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Resonite\rml_mods` for a default install. You can create it if it's missing, or if you launch the game once with ResoniteModLoader.
2. Start the game!

Thanks to those who helped me test this!
